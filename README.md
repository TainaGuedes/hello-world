# hello-world
Hey guys! Welcome to my profile. My name's TainÃ¡ and I'm from Brazil.
I'm a biologist and a Master student in ecology and biodiversity conservation. I've been studying birds since 2014 when I started my scietific journey and I investigated the richness and abundance, basically I counted them in differents types of enviroment. Now I got a new approach wich I've never thought much about: birds behavior - specifically parental care.
This new and exciting adventure is going to happen on the Pantanal from Mato-Grosso, Brazil, and the species is Cercomacra melanaria (Thamnophilidae). I'm curious to investigate how it's the parental care dynamics and why and what variables influence this.

Update soon!
